      <h3>What is SOLID?</h3>
      <p>
        Is an acronym for five object-oriented design (ODD) principles that was coined by 
        <span class="f4 light-red b">Michael Feathers</span> and popularized by 
        <span class="f4 light-red b">Robert Martin</span>. Here's a short definition of each one:
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="f4 light-red b">S</span> - <span class="f4 light-red">Single Responsibility</span>
        <br /><span class="f4 light-red b">O</span> - <span class="f4 light-red">Open-Closed</span>
        <br /><span class="f4 light-red b">L</span> - <span class="f4 light-red">Liskov Substituion</span>
        <br /><span class="f4 light-red b">I</span> - <span class="f4 light-red">Interface Segregation</span>
        <br /><span class="f4 light-red b">D</span> - <span class="f4 light-red">Dependency Inversion</span>
      </p>

      <p>
      These principles establish good practices for building software so that is easier to change and maintain.
      </p>

      <h3>Single Responsibility</h3>
      <p class="tc i">
      "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."
      </p>
      <p>
      This principle is the most important and fundamental of SOLID, the "responsibility" is defined as a reason
      to change. Gather together the things that change for the same reasons, separate those things that change
      for different reasons. Meaning that a class should have only one job. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As an example consider this class:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Jarvis
    def drive; end
    def cook; end
    def paint; end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      This class will change for 3 reasons, if <span class="f4 light-red b">Jarvis</span> needs to learn a new route, 
      a new recipe or a new painting technique. Instead we should have one class for each of these jobs:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Driver
    def drive; end
  end

  class Chef
    def cook; end
  end

  class Painter
    def paint; end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Open-Closed</h3>
      <p class="tc i">
      "You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it."
      </p>

      <p>
      Classes should be open to extensions and closed to modifications. If the behavior of a class is changed,
      it will affect all the systems using that class, if a class needs to do more things, the ideal approach
      is to extend the current functionality. Going back to our <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> class:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Chef
    def cook
      # make_breakfast
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      If we change the <span class="f4 light-red b">cook</span> method to make <span class="f4 light-red b">lunch</span> it
      will break all the places where the system expects the <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> to make a <span class="f4 light-red b">breakfast</span>.
      Instead we should extend the method:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Chef
    def cook(meal = :breakfast)
      case meal
      when :breakfast then make_breakfast
      when :lunch then make_lunch
      when :dinner then make_dinner
      end
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Liskov Substitution</h3>
      <p class="tc i">
      "Derived classes must be sustitutable for their base classes."
      </p>
      <p>
      This principle was created by <span class="f4 light-red b">Barbara Liskov</span>. If a class B is a subtype of A, then any
      objects of type A in the program can be replaced with objects of type B without altering any of the expected or desired 
      behavior of that program. Continuing with our delicious theme, we can have a <span class="f4 light-red b">Saucier</span>, 
      a chef who specializes in sauces:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Saucier &lt; Chef
    def cook(meal = :sauce)
      case meal
      when :sauce then make_sauce
      else
        super
      end
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      This <span class="f4 light-red b">Saucier</span> should be able to make sauces and in adition breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
      If our digital <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> gets sick, the <span class="f4 light-red b">Saucier</span> can replace it
      without problems. The child class should be able to do everything the parent class can do.
      </p>

      <h3>Interface Segregation</h3>
      <p class="tc i">
      "Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific."
      </p>

      <p>
      We could have a <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> class that does it all:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Chef
    def cook(meal = :breakfast)
      case meal
      when :breakfast then make_breakfast
      when :lunch then make_lunch
      when :dinner then make_dinner
      when :sauce then make_sauce
      when :dessert then make_dessert
      when :cake then make_cake
      end
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      If we have a client that only wants a saucier, all the other methods for different meals will never be used, is
      wastefull and my introduce bugs unrelated to the purpose for what the client is using the <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Is better to have smaller interfaces  with less methods than a big one that satisfies all clients but with functions that will
      not be used by all of them. In our gastronomic example, if the <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> class is required
      to make sauces and pastry, these actions will not be useful for all clients. 
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Saucier &lt; Chef
    def cook(meal = :sauce)
      case meal
      when :sauce then make_sauce
      else
        super
      end
    end
  end

  class Baker &lt; Chef
    def cook(meal = :cake)
      case meal
      when :cake then make_make
      else
        super
      end
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      These smaller interfaces also makes it easier to add a new <span class="f4 light-red b">Saucier</span> or a new <span class="f4 light-red b">Baker</span>
      considering we only need to implement a single method on each one, <span class="f4 light-red b">make_sauce</span> and <span class="f4 light-red b">make_cake</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>Dependency Inversion</h3>
      <p class="tc i">
      "Depend on abstractions, not on concretions"
      </p>

      <p>
      Let's consider our <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> uses a <span class="f4 light-red b">Knife</span> to cut onions, I know, sophisticated some would say.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Chef
    def cut_onions_with(Knife)
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      Awesome, Onions get chopped, but if we him a <span class="f4 light-red b">Sword</span> instead of a <span class="f4 light-red b">Knife</span>, 
      <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> goes mad and sets the kitchen on fire. Why? Can't a sword cut onions? 
      <br />It's beacause the Chef relies on the details of the Knife implementation, modules should not depend on each other details, they should
      depend on the abstraction. In this case the abstraction is the tool being used to cut the onions.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-ruby">
  class Chef
    def cut_onions_with(tool)
    end
  end
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      <span class="f4 light-red b">Chef</span> does not need to know the particulars of the tool, the tool just needs to be able to do the work and 
      apply to certain characteristics, it should be able to cut onions with a <span class="f4 light-red b">Knife</span>, <span class="f4 light-red b">Sword</span>
      or <span class="f4 light-red b">Chainsaw</span>, as far as they have a <span class="f4 light-red">:cutting_edge</span> attribute and a <span class="f4 light-red">cut</span>
      action, it should work.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 gray lh-copy tj ma2 pb4">
      These were the five <span class="f4 light-red b">SOLID</span> principles, they are good practices to make your code easy to adjust, extend and test. 
      They are not rules, laws or absolute trues, but more like common sense guidelines to solve everyday problems.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 gray lh-copy tj ma2 pb4">
Until the next one.
